# Description

This small project works as a test to show some google maps API functionalities through react components thanks to the library

npm i react-bingmaps[https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bingmaps]

## How to install

Remember to change your envexample and nowexample files to .env and now.json, inside those files you need to put a valid bing maps key to work correctly with their API...

This repository have a now file so, if you have configured and installed NOW cli and you wnt to see this project deployed somewhere you can only run:

```shell
npm install && now
```

If you don't have now but you have nvm then you can do (this, obviously does not deploy the project anywhere, is only to work locally):

```shell
nvm install && nvm use && npm start
```

And if you're still on a cave and you don't have none of those tools?, well... in that case I will recommend you to install any of the previous one or install node on at least 10.12 version to be able to run npm install and after that npm start

### How it works?

We still dont know =P
